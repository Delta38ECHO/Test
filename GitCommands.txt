This will be a moderate include of all the needed Git commands used to utilize GitHub.

To begin: 
Open up the directory of the GitHub via the GitHub website and copy the URL.
Then using command: git clone https://github.com/Delta38ECHO/Test  //URL example
-Will make a new directory in whatever space you use: CMD line on windows, or using vim or the Linux terminal.

Now with that directory in place->
git status

git status in the main git directory, this case is "Test" (DIrectroy takes name of githun respiratory name) will show difference between what's in 'this' test dir on your side VS what is in the respiratory on github.

Untracked:
Not used yet and not ready to be pushed to GitHubub.

->  Use: git add
$ git add filename.type  //ALL -> ||(or) git add * || git add -A || git add .

{Now use git status -> Filename.type ready to be committed.}
(File still isn't uploaded to github, but is ready to be placed in there.)

Now, use:
git commit -m "Message to describe what was done in this file"
-m = message

-> Now file(s) are committed, but still aren't uploaded to GitHub.
Using:
git push
(This uploads everything to GitHub that was ready to be committed.  Now all others who are using same respiratory can use:
git pull
(This pulls the latest update from GitHub for the current directory and overwrites any previous files...I think.)

WILL ADD:
Group work of adding/altering same files.
